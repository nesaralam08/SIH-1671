## Problem Statement ID	1671
### Develop a functional solution that demonstrates the face liveness detection
### Description	
#### 1. Background
UIDAI is building a browser-based face authentication platform, which will enable the aadhaar number holders to start and end the face authentication on the same device i.e desktop, mobile or tab. One of the key drivers for the success of the solution is face liveness detection in the browser context. This challenge seeks an innovative approach to implement face liveness using ML models which can be used in all forms of interfaces. 
#### 2. Problem Description
As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop passive or active liveness detection models that can be used in the browser context to prevent the use of photo-of-photo, video or any form of face spoofing mechanism. Teams may opt for passive - which would the use environment to detect the liveness of the actor or active - which engages the aadhaar number holder for some “action” to detect the liveness. The proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives. 
#### 3. The proposed solution must meet the following objectives.
- 3.1 Feature Requirement. Liveness detection of the Actor in the edge. Liveness detection to happen in the browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge context using ONNX or Tensor.js framework.
- 3.2 Model Inference Time. Liveness detection should be completed within 500ms for enhanced user experience.
- 3.3 Mode. The model may use active or passive or a combination of both to detect the liveness of the actor.
- 3.4 Model Size. The liveness model must not be more than 5Mb, so that it can be downloaded in the narrow bandwidth (3G/4G/5G) network without impacting the page load timing.
#### 4. Expected Solution
The expected outcome of this project is a functionalsolution that demonstrates the face liveness detection in the edge.
